# Ruby API library for the UCL API

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/uclapi.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/uclapi) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cbetta/uclapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cbetta/uclapi)

A wrapper for the [UCL API](https://uclapi.com/). Specification is as described in the the [developer documentation](https://docs.uclapi.com/).

## Installation

Either install directly or via bundler.

```rb
gem 'uclapi'
```

## Getting started

The client will accept the app token either as a parameter on initialization,
or as an environment variable. Additionally a `debug` parameter can be set to enable verbose debugging.

```rb
require 'uclapi'

# using parameters
client = UCLAPI::Client.new(token: '...')

# using environment variables:
# * UCLAPI_TOKEN
client = UCLAPI::Client.new
```

The client provides with direct access to every API call as documented in the
developer documentation. Additionally it also provides some convenience methods.

```rb
# get a room
room = client.roombookings.rooms.first
# get the bookings for a room
bookings = room.bookings
# get the equipment for a room
equipment = room.equipment
```

## Convenience methods

### `room.bookings`

Maps to `client.roombookings.bookings` and passes along all the
same parameters while automatically setting the `roomid` and `siteid`.

### `room.equipment`

Maps to `client.roombookings.equipment` and passes along all the
same parameters while automatically setting the `roomid` and `siteid`.

### `booking.room`

Maps to `client.roombookings.room` and passes along the `roomid` and `siteid`.

### `booking.next_page`

Maps to `client.roombookings.bookings` and passes along the `roomid`, `siteid` and `page_token` to fetch the next page.

### `equipment.room`

Maps to `client.roombookings.room` and passes along the `roomid` and `siteid`.
